1. Where can you find the lecture videos, slides, exercises, and problems?
1. How many missed classes are allowed without making arrangements with the professor?
1. What is a slip day, how many are you allowed?
1. Can slip days be used on labs?
// Should you expect all programming assignments to take you approximately the same amount of time?
1. According to the academic honesty policy, which of the following are permitted?
    - Talking about your approach to a problem with your classmates.
    - Submitting someone else’s program as your own.
    - Copying a few lines of someone else’s code into your solution, if you understand those lines in detail.
    - Looking at a classmate’s code, then immediately sitting down and typing out a very similar program, but with different variable names.
    - Looking at a classmate’s code, then taking a half hour break before sitting down to write your own.

## 1A - Computers and Hardware
1. Computers have (at least) two components that store information: main memory (RAM) and secondary storage (e.g., hard drives). Why are both needed?
1. Which hardware component actually executes software instructions? Can it directly execute Python instructions?

## 1B - Algorithms and Pseudocode
1. Write pseudocode for a program that repeatedly prompts a user for non-negative integers; once the user inputs a negative number, the program ends and outputs the sum of the input positive integers.

## 1C - Calling Functions, print, and input
1. Which of the following lines of Python contain a comment?
    1. ` # Author: Prof X `
    1. ` print("Hello!") # greet the user `
    1. ` input("Enter your favorite 2-digit number (##): ") `
 
1. What does the following code print? 

` print("CSCI", 99 + 42, "at WWU") `

1. What does the following code print?
` print("CSCI", "99 + 42", "at WWU") `

1. How many arguments are given to the following call to the print function?
` print("CSCI", 99 + 42, "at WWU") `

Reminder: only the Exercises above need to be completed and submitted before class. The following Problem will be worked on in class.

Problem
Write a math quiz program that works as follows: it begins by printing an arithmetic problem of your choosing. Then, it prompts the user to enter an answer. Finally, once they have pressed enter, the program prints a message showing the correct answer. Note: we don’t yet know how to check if the user’s answer was correct, but we’ll get there soon! A couple sample runs of such a program are shown below; note that the number at the end of the first line is what’s typed by the user before they press enter:

What is 4 * 6? 24
4 * 6 is 24.
What is 4 * 6? 22
4 * 6 is 24.
